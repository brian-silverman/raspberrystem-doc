    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Intro to the RaspberrySTEM&trade;What is the the
      RaspberrySTEM&trade;?</h2>

      <p>The RaspberrySTEM&trade; is a programming and electronics
      kit that provides a complete platform to design and build
      electronics projects that interact with the real-world - and
      even solve real-world problems.&nbsp; The
      RaspberrySTEM&trade; is built on the Raspberry Pi&reg; single
      board computer, a popular computer board with an active
      online community worldwide.</p>

      <p>Paired with a programming and electronics curriculum
      geared towards students in 4th through 12th grade, the
      RaspberrySTEM&trade; is a cutting-edge learning tool that is
      both fun and functional.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Who is this manual for?</h2>

      <p>This manual is written for educators that want to bring a
      programming and electronics curriculum to their classroom,
      after-school enrichment program, extra-curricular group, or
      technology camp.</p>Teacher prerequisites<br>

      <ul>
        <li>Basic understanding of electronics, specifically the
        concepts of:</li>

        <li style=
        "list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">
        <ul>
            <li>Electricity is a flow of charged particles</li>

            <li>The water analogy for explaining electronics</li>

            <li>Voltage and current</li>

            <li>The primary parts of a computer: Processor, memory,
            and IO.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Basic understanding of programming, specifically in
        Python, including:</li>

        <li style=
        "list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">
        <ul>
            <li>Statements</li>

            <li>Conditionals</li>

            <li>Loops</li>

            <li>Functions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Advanced concepts are not required.</li>
      </ul><br>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>How to use this manual</h2>

      <p>TBD</p>

      <p>Projects are guides.&nbsp; Split into
      discussions/activities.&nbsp; Intended to jumpstart larger
      self-guided projects.</p>

      <p>Projects a split in to roughly 1 hours blocks, but
      strongly depend on age, experience, group size, and other
      factors.</p>

      <p>Projects should be adapted to the specific needs of the
      class and environment.&nbsp; Projects are intended to be
      self-contained &ndash; generally each project teaches a new
      skill or feature.&nbsp; When combined together, a group of
      projects can create a full new interactive product.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>About our Curriculum</h2>

      <p>The goal of this manual is to provide a framework for
      using the RaspberrySTEMTM in a structured educational
      setting.&nbsp; Lesson plans are only suggestions and can be
      readily modified for the target age group and level of
      experience.&nbsp; They can be mixed and matched to
      accommodate specific subject matter and to adhere to the time
      constraints of the course.&nbsp; Throughout the lesson plans,
      we will make recommendations for how the plans can be
      modified and adapted for different age groups and
      abilities.</p>

            resistor and one lead of the LED around the battery
            with the left hand, and pinch the remaining LED and
            resistor leads together with the right hand.<br>
            <br>
            Note: Current will only flow through the LED in one
            direction, therefore you must connect it up correctly
            (no harm done if you don't, but it won't work). The
            cathode of the LED (has the shorter lead, and has a
            flat side) should be connected to the negative side of
            the battery.<br>
            Note: An LED throwie can be made without the resistor,
            however it is considered bad practice to do so as it
            either it can possibly damage either the battery or LED
            (the resistor is used to limit the current through the
            circuit to a reasonable level).&nbsp; But, as the LED
            throwies are often only temporarily, they are often
            made with the resistor.&nbsp; In this exercise, though,
            it makes sense to teach the proper way to connect up an
            LED.<br>

            What is the LED Matrix RaspberrySTEM Cell?<br>
            It consists of:<br>
            A LED Matrix driver PCB &ndash; a circuit board, that
            receives data from the Raspberry Pi, and displays it on
            an LED Matrix using a small low-power micro-controller
            (Atmel ATTiny48<br>
            An LED Matrix &ndash; a grid of LEDs, where for each
            row the anode (positive-side) of the LEDs are connected
            together.&nbsp; LED matrices can only show one unique
            row of LEDs lit at one time, therefore the
            micro-controller is required to sequence through each
            row one at a time.&nbsp; This occurs faster than the
            eye can perceive (through the eye's persistence of
            vision), and therefore appears to be a solid image.<br>
            Communication from the Raspberry Pi to the LED Matrix
            RaspberrySTEM Cell occurs over the SPI bus<br>
            The SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a common
            interface for sending data between processors and other
            ICs.<br>
            The micro-controller stores the brightness level of
            each LED, on a scale from 0-15.&nbsp; In order to
            update the full LED Matrix display, the Raspberry Pi
            must send 64 (i.e., 8 x 8) brightness levels, one for
            each LED, to the&nbsp; LED Matrix RaspberrySTEM
            Cell.<br>
