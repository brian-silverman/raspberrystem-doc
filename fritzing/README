FRITZING PARTS FILES

Fritzing supports user parts libaraies, which it calls bins.  We have a
RaspberrySTEM bin, which contains RaspberrySTEM Cells and other parts.

CREATING PARTS

To create a part:
    - Right click on a existing part that's the most similar to the new part,
      and choose "Edit part (new parts editor)..."
    - Save as new part.  Choose default prefix.
    - Drag part from MINE bin to RaspberrySTEM bin
    - The part in MINE can now be deleted (or kept)

Part can be further edited using the parts editor.

EXPORT

To export the RaspberrySTEM bin, select the bin, choose "Export Bin..." from
the drop down menu, and export to this directory.

IMPORT

To import, choose "Import..." from the drop down menu, and import the .fzbz
file.  Note that this will likely create a duplicate bin in the bin list.   The
extra bin can be removed.

The image files for the bin are stored separately in this in directory, and
need to be installed manually the first time the bin is imported.  To do so,
from this directory:
    
    cp *.png ~/.config/Fritzing/bins

One potential issue - the .fzbz file has some hardcoded /User paths in it -
this may need to be resolved.
