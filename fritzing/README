FRITZING PARTS FILES

Fritzing supports user parts libaraies, which it calls bins.  We have a
RaspberrySTEM bin, which contains RaspberrySTEM Cells and other parts.

CREATING PARTS

To create a part:
    - Right click on a existing part that's the most similar to the new part,
      and choose "Edit part (new parts editor)..."
    - Save as new part.  Choose default prefix.
    - Drag part from MINE bin to RaspberrySTEM bin
    - The part in MINE must NOT be deleted!  Perhaps it can be deleted later if
      the bin is reimported.

Part can be further edited using the parts editor.

EXPORT

Before Export, make sure to first save and close the open bins, then close and
reopen the Fritzing app.  Otherwise, it appears Fritzing will export old data.

To export the RaspberrySTEM bin, select the bin, choose "Export Bin..." from
the drop down menu, and export to this directory.

After export, you may want to untar the resulting .fzbz file, and verify that
the svg files within it are correct.

IMPORT

To import, choose "Import..." from the drop down menu, and import the .fzbz
file.  Note that this will likely create a duplicate bin in the bin list.   The
extra bin can be removed.

The image files for the bin are stored separately in this in directory, and
need to be installed manually the first time the bin is imported.  To do so,
from this directory:
    
    cp *.png ~/.config/Fritzing/bins

One potential issue - the .fzbz file has some hardcoded /User paths in it -
this may need to be resolved.
